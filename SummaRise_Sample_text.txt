An evaluation metric is a quantitative measure used to assess the performance or effectiveness of a system, model, algorithm, or process. It provides a standardized way to evaluate how well the system or model is performing according to specific criteria or objectives. Evaluation metrics are often tailored to the particular task or domain being evaluated and are designed to capture various aspects of performance, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mean squared error, or others, depending on the nature of the problem. These metrics provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the system or model, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions about improvements or optimizations.
